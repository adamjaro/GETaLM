#Instantaneous luminosity, cm^-2 sec^-1
#
#Lumi per 5 hours fill is 1.3 pb^-1 (page 20 in Elke's slides), means average instantaneous 7.22 x 10^31 cm^-2 sec^-1,
#top instantaneous at the beginning of the fill, guess from the plot on the same page: 0.2 x 10^33 cm^-2 sec^-1
#
#All above luminosity figures are per nucleon, L_eN, to be scaled to observed luminosity L_inst used in the configuation
#below as  L_inst = L_eN / A

#L_inst = 7.52e29 ; average instantaneous luminosity during the fill, cm^-2 sec^-1
L_inst = 2.083e30 ; top instantaneous at the beginning of the fill, cm^-2 sec^-1
